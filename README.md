# React Notes

I started off creating a test note and rendering it to the screen. I then moved to creating notes and passing props such as content, positions, and event handlers from one component to another. Once I had the front end functionality working, I implemented Firebase and styled the notes.

## What Worked Well
Implementing event handlers and passing props took a while to figure out and understand, but once I did, everything fit in almost seamlessly. The isEditing idea in the lab instructions worked like a charm.

## What Didn't
Styling was a bit of a struggle as I had to play around a lot to get the notes to look just right and to not let any content overflow. I also struggled with the z-index part, as I couldn't figure out how to make it so that a note is brought to the very front on click.
